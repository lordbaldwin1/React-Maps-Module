# Types

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces used throughout the application.

## Key Files

- `ChargeSite.ts`: Types related to charge sites and geographical regions
- `CustomMarker.ts`: Types for custom map markers
- `Filters.ts`: Types for filter states used in the application

## Best Practices

- Keep type definitions focused and specific
- Use meaningful names that clearly describe the data structure
- Export types and interfaces to be used across the application
- Use union types and intersection types when appropriate
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments
