# Pages

This directory contains top-level page components that correspond to different routes in the application.

## Structure

Each file in this directory typically represents a distinct page or view in the application. These components are usually rendered by the router.

## Best Practices

- Keep page components focused on layout and composition
- Use components from the `components` directory to build pages
- Handle data fetching and state management at this level when appropriate
- Use React Router for navigation between pages
